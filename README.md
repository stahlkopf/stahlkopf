- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™d prefer not to put my name out there 
my github account is really just for random ideas/concepts normally
that I worked on as side projects for fun

It has mainly old code side projects (which are bad)
and some newly added stuff I've uploaded just to archive here


I've added some useful concepts/ideas that is relevant to my career and I have much more I can showcase as a portfolio if needed
I may take some things down or move to private as I am only making certain stuff available as a github link is a mandatory field for levers application page

Client Success related repositories will be templates and example report images created and used as temporary portfolio
